When we create an AWS account,the root account is created by default. It is a good practice to use the root account to setup other IAM users.
Most companies or individuals prefer to use this account as an administrator account. 
The administrator account would be incharge of handling:

Creation of users
Assigning policies or permissions to users
Granting access to certain AWS services
Creating password policies
Creating groups and organization and many moreâ€¦

As an administrator,you are to ensure that the root account serves only the above listed purposes. It is safer to carry out other task as normal users created by the
root account. Activities such as lambda-function,ec2-insances should be performed on normal users account and not on the root account.
