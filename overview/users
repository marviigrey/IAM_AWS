USERS

Users can be classified as individuals in a group that have access to limited services setup by the root account in AWS.
These users can be in different groups serving different purposes,can bein a single group to carry out just one purpose
or can standalone and still carry out a given purpose in an organisation.Users have policies that they follow, We will 
talk about policies in the next lines,but for now see policies as rules.We have users in a group simply to use services
in our AWS account.
